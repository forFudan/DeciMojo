# DeciMojo

A correctly-rounded, fixed-point decimal arithmetic library for the [Mojo programming language ðŸ”¥](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

## Overview

DeciMojo provides a Decimal type implementation for Mojo with fixed-precision arithmetic, designed to handle financial calculations and other scenarios where floating-point rounding errors are problematic.

## Objective

Financial calculations and data analysis require precise decimal arithmetic that floating-point numbers cannot reliably provide. As someone working in finance and credit risk model validation, I needed a dependable fixed-precision numeric type when migrating my personal projects from Python to Mojo.

Since Mojo currently lacks a native Decimal type in its standard library, I decided to create my own implementation to fill that gap.

This project draws inspiration from several established decimal implementations and documentation, e.g., [Python built-in `Decimal` type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html), [Rust `rust_decimal` crate](https://docs.rs/rust_decimal/latest/rust_decimal/index.html), [Microsoft's `Decimal` implementation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.decimal.getbits?view=net-9.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN#System_Decimal_GetBits_System_Decimal_), [General Decimal Arithmetic Specification](https://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html), etc. Many thanks to these predecessors for their contributions and their commitment to open knowledge sharing.

## Issues
